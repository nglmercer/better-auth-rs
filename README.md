# Better Auth for Rust

This repository is the initial Rust rewrite foundation described by the
attached architecture roadmap. It is framework-neutral: an Axum, Actix, or
other integration can translate its native requests into `RequestMetadata` and
use the same auth context and security behavior.

## Workspace layout

- `crates/better-auth-core` contains shared options, adapter traits, schema
  definitions, and the plugin registry.
- `crates/better-auth` contains the runtime `AuthContext`, per-request base URL
  resolution, cookies, secret rotation, scrypt password hashing, and CSRF/IP
  helpers.

## Current implementation

The foundation covers roadmap phases 0–5 at the contract/runtime level:

- configuration validation and the no-durable-store cookie-cache defaults;
- static, request-derived, and allowed-host dynamic base URLs;
- relational and secondary-storage adapter contracts, including TTL and atomic
  increment semantics;
- core schema plus conflict-safe plugin schema merging;
- plugin endpoints, hooks, and error-code aggregation;
- versioned HMAC envelopes for direct secret-version lookup during rotation;
- scrypt password hashing;
- SameSite=Lax session-cookie construction;
- Origin, Fetch Metadata, trusted-proxy, and trusted-IP-header helpers.

OAuth/PKCE, full email/password endpoints, durable session lifecycle, framework
adapters, and advanced plugins remain the next implementation layers. The
traits are intentionally small so those features can be added without making
the core depend on a database or web framework.
